First you need to make it executable 
```c
chmod +x local-php-security-checker_1.2.0_linux_amd64
```

You can copy this in the php project folder. (Which contains composer folder)

From a directory containing a PHP project that uses Composer, check for known
vulnerabilities by running the binary without arguments or flags:

    $ local-php-security-checker

You can also pass a `--path` to check a specific directory:

    $ local-php-security-checker --path=/path/to/php/project
    $ local-php-security-checker --path=/path/to/php/project/composer.lock
