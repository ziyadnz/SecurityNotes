RFID 
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) has been using mostly at the security of the buildings.
Radio waves are sent to the card and received back by the antenna wirelessly. Although it looks
like it is high technology, the problem with the RFID is that they can be copied using low-budget
tools such as Arduino and RC522. The RC522 modul is used to identify the cards which works on
13.56 MHz. By using Arduinoâ€™s default examples such as DumpInfo the data inside a card or an
RFID tag can be seen. Further on, it can be transferred to a new blank card using writeBlock
function.
Libraries are available in arduino market.
